# Vite To-Do List

This is a simple to-do list application built with React, TypeScript, and Vite. It uses the `ts-localstorage` package for storing to-do items in the browser's local storage, and `uuid` for generating unique IDs for each to-do item.

## Installation

To install the dependencies for this project, run the following command:

npm install


## Usage

To start the development server, run:

npm run dev

This will start the server and open the app in your default browser. You can add, edit, and delete to-do items from the app.

To build the production version of the app, run:

npm run build


This will compile the TypeScript code and create a production-ready build of the app in the `dist` folder.
